### **Code**
This directory contains the C and Assembly files for the grayscale image conversion program. The main focus is on the implementation and performance of `imgCvtGrayInttoFloat()`.

### **Screenshots**
This directory contains screenshots for the project, including sample outputs and benchmarks captured during both **debug** and **release** modes.

## **The C Program**

The C program acts as a driver for testing both the **C kernel** and the **Assembly kernel** implementations. It includes:
- **Timing Mechanism**: Tracks the average execution time and the number of executions for each kernel.
- **Sanity Check**: Compares the results of both kernels to ensure correctness. For all sample images, the outputs are validated to match.

The pixel values for grayscale images are generated by simulating repetitive patterns, ensuring consistent test conditions.

### **Test Configurations**
The tests were conducted with the following image sizes:
- **10 × 10 pixels**
- **100 × 100 pixels**
- **1000 × 1000 pixels**

## **Sample Results**

### **10 × 10 Pixels**

### **100 × 100 Pixels**

### **1000 × 1000 Pixels**

## **Conclusion**

The program provides a comparative analysis of the performance of C and Assembly implementations for converting grayscale images. While assembly is generally optimized for such tasks, compiler optimizations allow the C kernel to achieve faster execution times in this case.
